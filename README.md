    The goal is to help our partners understand how we run the evaluation phase with prospects, why and give them the best practices.
  </p>

## Working environment

All partners will receive:

- A Grafana Cloud stack
- A web-terminal
- Access from the terminal to a Kubernetes cluster (GKE) with a fake app running

## Goals

Partners will need to prepare a Proof of Value in concordance with the needs of the prospect.

## Know before you go

We recommend that you read the [bootstrap page](/bootstrap/README.md) to learn how to install some useful tools for the exercise.

We also recommend that you read the [deployment page]() to understand how you can deploy your modifications in the prospect environment.
